SERVER
--> nodeJs (backend framework)
    http
        https://nodejs.org/api/http.html
        http is a module in node.  Node.js needs to create http/https servers, hence we have to import the http module in order to create an HTTP Server. Thus,
        var http = require('http') is just to import the built-in http module, so that we can create http server which will respond to our requests. 
        After importing the module, a server can be created by using the createServer() method offered by http module var server = http.createServer(handleRequest);
    
    express (routing and middleware framework)
            https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html
             Uses middleware functions to handle the following;
             -Execute any code
             -Make changes to teh request and response objects
             -End the request-response cycle
             -Call the next middleware function in the stack
        app (handles individual routes via the route-handler model)
